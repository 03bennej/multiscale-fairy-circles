# Supporting code for the paper "Phenotypic plasticity â€“ a missing element in the theory of vegetation pattern formation"

Part of the code in this repo is intended to be accelerated on GPUs. We used [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) which requires an NVIDIA CUDA GPU and CUDA Toolkit. For the specific installation requirements for your system, see the up-to-date installation instructions: [https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html), in particular, how to install the correct version of CUDA Toolkit for your system.
